# deep-learning

Projects done in Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity and other projects (to do):

- handwriting generation: (1) create a database containing fractions of handwriting (of the same person) using the EMNIST dataset,          (2) implement a GAN to generate more fractions similar to the original one, (3) use the output to get a handwritten version of a given text, (4) test the result by handwriting recognition software

- emotion_recognition: (1) find or create a database with faces that have emotions as labels assigned to them, (2) monitor the face of people through a camera and keep track of the emotions, (3) the aim is to generate something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGyEf7dWuPU

- learn_diet: (1) create a database that contains the daily food and drink consumption of a person, (2) find a database with nutrition data of the consumed food and drink, (3) train a network to learn about the eating and drinking habit of the person, (4) generate menus based on the explored diet rules.
